| [Solution-1 (Recursive)](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/587134672/)
| [Solution-2 (Iterative)](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/587140832/)

### C++

#### Solution-1 (Recursive)
```c++
// Time Complexity: O(N) each node is traversed
// Space Complexity: O(N) recursion stack

class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* prev = nullptr;
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        if(root == nullptr) return;
        
        flatten(root->right);
        flatten(root->left);
        
        root->right = prev;
        root->left = nullptr;
        prev = root;
    }
};
```

#### Solution-2 (Iterative - Using concept of Morris traversal)
```c++
// Time Complexity: O(N) each node is traversed
// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Observation: "For a node, its predecessor will always point to its right child."

class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* curr = root;
        
        while(curr){
            if(curr->left == NULL)
                curr = curr->right;
            else {
                TreeNode* pred = curr->left;
                while(pred->right) pred = pred->right;
                
                pred->right = curr->right;
                curr->right = curr->left;
                curr->left = nullptr;
            }
        }
        
        return;
    }
};
